  Enter your OAuth Personal Access Token. A personal access token is generated when you create a new Runscope application. This makes it easy to use the API without building a web flow. We suggest that you create a unique application (which generates a personal access token) that is used exclusively for this Runscope/Jenkins integration.<br /><br />To obtain a new personal access token, create a new Runscope application by visiting <a href="https://www.runscope.com/applications/create" target="_blank">this link</a>. For Website and Callback URL values, just enter in any valid URL (i.e. http://localhost). The URLs will not be called. After creating the new application, copy the access token provided into your clipboard then paste the token into this field.
